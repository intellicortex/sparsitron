# sparsitron
SPARSITRON is a sparse, event-driven learning architecture designed to enforce hard bounds on computation while supporting continual adaptation through structural plasticity and consolidation.

## What this repository contains

This repository provides a public, IP-safe benchmark harness and reference
implementation demonstrating the execution invariants of the SPARSITRON
architecture, including:

- Hard compute governance via routing budgets
- Adaptive inverse-fan-out behavior
- Integer-based node dynamics
- Continual adaptation under task drift (synthetic)
- Memory stabilization via consolidation proxies
- Hybrid control of dense computation (toy demo)
